# AI Support Signal Triage Agent

This repository documents a **human-in-the-loop AI agent** designed to help support, product, and engineering teams triage incoming support signals in a structured, explainable way.

The focus of this project is **decision quality and reasoning**, not automation or production deployment.

## Problem

Support signals arrive from many channels such as email, chat, app feedback, and reviews.
They are often noisy, duplicated, and unstructured.

Teams spend significant time manually:

- Identifying what is urgent
- Grouping related issues
- Deciding who should act

This increases response time and raises the risk of missing critical incidents.

## Solution

This project defines an **AI Support Signal Triage Agent** that:

- Classifies support signals into operational categories
- Assigns conservative P0–P3 priorities
- Detects duplicates and clusters related issues
- Recommends a clear next action and owning team
- Explains why each decision was made
- Produces an executive-ready daily digest

The agent is intentionally designed as **decision support**, not autonomous automation.

## What this project is (and is not)

### This is:

- A reusable AI reasoning workflow
- Human-in-the-loop by design
- Explainable and conservative
- Reproducible at zero cost

### This is not:

- A production automation system
- A ticketing or auto-reply bot
- A framework showcase
- A commercial SaaS product

## How to use this repository

You can reproduce the agent behavior with **no paid tools**:

  1. Open a fresh ChatGPT conversation
  2. Copy the agent prompt from [`agent/prompt.md`](agent/prompt.md)
  3. Paste the sample dataset from [`data/raw_signals_sample.csv`](data/raw_signals_sample.csv)
  4. Run the instruction described in the workflow guide
  5. Review the structured output and digest

Full step-by-step instructions are in [`docs/workflow-guide-v2.3.pdf`](docs/workflow-guide-v2.3.pdf).
